# VM Deltas

Change records that describe modifications applied to CORE_VM.md.

## File Naming Convention

`VM_DELTA_<THREADNAME>_<YYYYMMDD-HHMM>.md`

## Organization

Files are organized by month (`YYYY-MM/`) to prevent directory bloat.

All deltas are immutable. Changes are applied in order via REBUILD_INDEX.md.
