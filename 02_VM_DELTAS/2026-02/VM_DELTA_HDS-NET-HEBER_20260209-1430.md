[2026-02-09] Hermes Data Systems adopted an Evergreen Compute Refresh doctrine defining three asset life layers: 20+ year building infrastructure, 10-15 year plant equipment, and 3-5 year IT payload refresh cycles.

[2026-02-09] Hermes standardized vendor-agnostic rack slot envelopes (Slot S, Slot H, Slot X) defined by power, thermal, and interface constraints rather than silicon vendor.

[2026-02-09] Hermes formally prohibited dependency on chilled coolant and ammonia refrigerant inside compute buildings, enforcing warm-water liquid cooling with external heat exchange only.

[2026-02-09] Hermes adopted accelerator lane governance requiring single-silicon ecosystems per pod and prohibiting mixed accelerator lanes within a pod.

[2026-02-09] Hermes established a pod-group-level evergreen refresh model allowing rolling rack upgrades without building-wide downtime.

[2026-02-09] Hermes defined a dual Meet-Me Room (MMR-A/MMR-B) standard with physically diverse ingress routes as mandatory for all campuses.

[2026-02-09] Hermes adopted a network strategy to operate as its own network operator and private backbone, with a phased roadmap toward obtaining an autonomous system (ASN) and peering, while explicitly rejecting retail ISP operations.

[2026-02-09] Hermes defined a minimum campus carrier diversity requirement of three upstream providers with physical route and POP diversity verified by carrier route letters.

[2026-02-09] Hermes adopted ring-based inter-campus backbone topology as mandatory, explicitly prohibiting star topologies for federation traffic.

[2026-02-09] Hermes formalized an async-first federation doctrine for cross-campus workloads, reserving synchronous tightly coupled training to intra-campus or metro-scale deployments only.

[2026-02-09] Hermes approved Starlink enterprise connectivity as a tertiary, non-terrestrial communications leg limited to out-of-band management and emergency continuity, not tenant data plane traffic.

[2026-02-09] Hermes defined a Heber Campus-specific network redundancy plan utilizing the SR-260 corridor and the I-40 corridor as physically diverse terrestrial fiber legs.

[2026-02-09] Hermes established mandatory acceptance testing for campus network redundancy including carrier failover, MMR isolation, and tertiary path validation.
