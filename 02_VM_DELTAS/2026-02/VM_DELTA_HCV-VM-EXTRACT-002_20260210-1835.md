[2026-02-10] Decision established that Fusion 360 combined with GIS constitutes the authoritative engineering truth layer for campus-wide design; Photoshop and Google Earth are formally designated as downstream visualization and communication tools only.

[2026-02-10] Architecture rule formalized: campus geometry, zoning, corridors, and interfaces must be defined in engineering-grade CAD (Fusion/GIS) prior to any rendered or illustrative outputs; visualization tools are prohibited from serving as upstream design authorities.

[2026-02-10] Decision adopted that Google Earth shall be used exclusively as a presentation and walkthrough layer derived from authoritative CAD/GIS outputs, and shall not be used for primary planning, geometry definition, or engineering decisions.

[2026-02-10] Governance sequencing rule clarified: agent SDK provisioning and work-order-driven engineering execution must precede detailed CAD modeling; exploratory or ad-hoc modeling in Fusion without governance context is disallowed.

[2026-02-10] Accepted execution doctrine that campus design proceeds top-down: requirements and logic management → agent-generated engineering artifacts → CAD integration → visualization export, with no inversion of this sequence permitted.
