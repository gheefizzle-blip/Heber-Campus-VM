## DELTA BEGIN

[2026-02-07] Heber Campus integration concept: Biomass plant added to enable capture of biogenic CO2 for use as carbon feedstock in downstream chemical manufacturing.
[2026-02-07] SOEC steam conditioning concept: Biomass/HRSG provides mid-grade steam; final lift to SOEC hot-box inlet temperature is provided by a dedicated trim-heater stage.
[2026-02-07] Byproduct O2 utilization concept: SOEC byproduct oxygen is treated as an oxidizer supply for trim heaters; oxygen is not a fuel and must be paired with a combustible stream.
[2026-02-07] Trim-heater fuel concept: Petrochemical/byproduct combustibles (syngas, off-gases, purge gases, light ends, other internal byproducts without market value) are eligible fuels for trim heaters to superheat steam to SOEC operating range.
[2026-02-07] Contamination control rule: Combustion products from trim heating shall not be introduced into the SOEC process gas path unless explicitly vendor-approved; default architecture is indirect-fired heat transfer.
[2026-02-07] Thermal protection rule: SOEC hot-box control must enforce slow ramp-up/ramp-down with gradient limits to avoid thermal shock and stack damage.
[2026-02-07] Instrumentation requirement: Trim-heater operation requires continuous monitoring of fuel composition/quality (or LHV surrogate), fuel flow, O2 flow/purity, flame presence, and steam temperature at key points to control both steam outlet temperature and combustion stoichiometry safely.
[2026-02-07] Phasing note: SMR reactors remain planned primary high-grade thermal sources, but regulatory approvals may delay deployment by years; biomass can enable earlier (smaller-scale) production prior to SMR availability.
[2026-02-07] Regional benchmark note: Novo BioPower (Snowflake, AZ) identified as a nearby real-world biomass power-only reference plant (~24-28 MW electric class) with no public indication of SOEC or electrolysis integration.
