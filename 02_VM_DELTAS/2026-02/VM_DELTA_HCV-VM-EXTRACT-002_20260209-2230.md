[2026-02-09] Confirmed that Aegis is a Recursive Language Model (RLM) system based on the MIT RLM study, serving as the semantic orchestration spine for regulatory compliance rather than a standalone regulatory agent.

[2026-02-09] Formalized the operating model where Agent A (ChatGPT) functions as a Digital Twin and work-order author, Aegis performs recursive semantic decomposition and constraint propagation, and a 30+ SDK Agent Swarm executes engineering tasks with continuous compliance checks.

[2026-02-09] Locked program sequencing: Bible Rev 4.1 establishes architectural truth; Aegis RLM establishes semantic compliance truth; CAD execution (Onshape via Claude Code) implements physical geometry constrained by Aegis outputs; drawings and permit artifacts follow as evidence.

[2026-02-09] Accepted parallel execution model allowing Aegis RLM development and Onshape CAD learning to proceed concurrently, provided CAD work is confined to a SANDBOX classification with explicit prohibition on compliance claims or promotion.

[2026-02-09] Established mandatory separation between SANDBOX CAD artifacts and AUTHORITATIVE CAD artifacts, including directory segregation, naming prefixes, and work-order classification flags to prevent premature promotion.

[2026-02-09] Defined that CAD geometry may not claim regulatory compliance until Aegis emits constraint objects with IDs consumable by CAD work orders.

[2026-02-09] Locked that Claude Code acts as a deterministic operator executing explicit work orders only, with no interpretive authority over architecture or compliance.

[2026-02-09] Confirmed that ATB (Agent Technical Board) provides independent safety, compliance, and quality gate oversight with veto authority.
