## DELTA BEGIN

[2026-02-09] R&D scope expanded beyond efficiency and safety optimization to include generative engineering of non-existent infrastructure required for space and orbital operations.

[2026-02-09] R&D charter includes invention of new materials, coatings, joining methods, and manufacturing processes with no terrestrial equivalents.

[2026-02-09] Purpose-built robotic systems for microgravity manufacturing are designated as core R&D outputs, not derivative adaptations of terrestrial automation.

[2026-02-09] Microgravity manufacturing defined as a first-principles engineering domain; gravity-dependent processes are considered non-viable by default for OSY deployment.

[2026-02-09] Orbital Shipyard (OSY) designated as heavy vehicle manufacturing environment requiring space-native manufacturing architectures developed through R&D.

[2026-02-09] Heber Campus designated as ground-truth validation environment for space infrastructure R&D, including materials, robotics, coatings, and manufacturing physics prior to orbital deployment.
