## DELTA BEGIN

[2026-02-07] AO-based campus master planning has progressed to v0.4, establishing fixed block coordinates, safety setbacks, wind-aligned zoning, and modular ICD-00 interconnection doctrine as canonical planning inputs for the Heber Campus.
[2026-02-07] The Heber Campus AO v0.4 is designated as the authoritative spatial reference for downstream CAD drafting, with MECHWORK tasked to produce scaled A0 master site plans derived directly from AO coordinates without approximation.
[2026-02-07] Vector-mapped, near-scale visual representations are approved as intermediate planning artifacts, but CAD (DWG/PDF) outputs are required for any document entering engineering or ATB review.
[2026-02-07] Execution authority was granted to advance the AO v0.4 master plan into formal MECHWORK CAD drafting, marking transition from conceptual layout to engineering-grade site documentation.
