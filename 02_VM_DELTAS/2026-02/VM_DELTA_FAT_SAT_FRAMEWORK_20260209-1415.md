[2026-02-09] Milestone payments are gated exclusively by SAT acceptance; partial acceptance is explicitly disallowed.
[2026-02-09] Vendors are required to provide full, unfiltered, time-synchronized raw test data; ownership of all FAT and SAT data is assigned to the owner.
[2026-02-09] Electrolyzer procurement contracts must include endurance testing, dynamic load testing, impurity stress testing, and degradation baselining as non-waivable acceptance criteria.
