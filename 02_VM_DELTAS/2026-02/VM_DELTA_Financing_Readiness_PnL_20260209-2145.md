[2026-02-09] Adopted accounting rule: fuel production cost is defined as direct COGS only (~$65–70/bbl at steady state), with all campus overhead excluded from unit costs and reported as a single campus-level overhead line below contribution margin (Option A).

[2026-02-09] Formalized P&L structure for all phases: Revenue → Direct Costs (COGS by leg) → Contribution Margin → Campus Overhead (single line) → EBITDA → Debt Service → Net Cash Flow.

[2026-02-09] Approved consolidation of phase P&Ls into a single columnar P&L view (phases as columns) due to identical layout; individual per-phase tabs are not required for presentation.

[2026-02-09] Accepted data center phasing doctrine: Phase 1 = colocation only; Phase 2 = add AI/HPC data centers; Phases 3–6 = balanced addition of colocation and AI/HPC; AI silicon CAPEX included with a four-year refresh cycle.

[2026-02-09] Confirmed phase-scaled ancillary revenues: oxygen sales, calcium/mineral pellets (ramping to ~30 tpd at full build), and software licensing (MECSAI/Aegis) scale by phase and are additive; none are required for base project viability.

[2026-02-09] Integrated fuel economics requirement: include explicit fuel production cost ($/bbl direct COGS) and delivered fuel ($/gal) comparisons against 12-month trailing average market benchmarks (ULSD Gulf Coast, Jet Gulf Coast, Propane Mont Belvieu), with volatility ranges documented.

[2026-02-09] Approved CFO presentation standards for financial artifacts: formula-driven model (no hard-coded totals), assumptions isolated in a single inputs tab, and charts embedded on relevant pages (Executive, Fuels, Data Centers) rather than aggregated on a single charts page.

[2026-02-09] Accepted funding-readiness integration rule: financing eligibility and readiness gates (DOE LPO, NRC COL, offtake, EPC, equity) must be operationalized within the financial model as explicit status items, not narrative-only documentation.
