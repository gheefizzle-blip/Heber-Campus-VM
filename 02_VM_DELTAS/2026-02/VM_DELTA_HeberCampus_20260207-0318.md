[2026-02-07] Phase 1 site geometry for the Heber Campus must be designed to preserve Phase 2 expansion capability to approximately 5 GW total solar capacity and expansion of data centers beyond the Phase 1 baseline without rework.

[2026-02-07] Export substation location is fixed in the northwest quadrant of the Heber Campus due to shortest MVAC tie-in to regional transmission corridors and must reserve full Phase 2 footprint at Phase 1.

[2026-02-07] Solar field primary siting is designated in the northwest quadrant with reserved geographic sweep corridors for future expansion consistent with modular duplication doctrine.

[2026-02-07] Internal campus medium-voltage electrical distribution must be loop-capable at full buildout; radial-only Phase 1 configurations are prohibited.

[2026-02-07] Phase 1 layout must reserve spatial pads and utility corridors for the ultimate data center district, including all future buildings, even if only a subset is constructed initially.

[2026-02-07] Phase 1 design must freeze primary infrastructure corridors (power, cooling, water, fire protection, hydrogen) aligned to ultimate buildout and may not constrain later phases.

[2026-02-07] AO design outputs are subject to a governance alignment check against HC-MGD-001 and the Master Architecture Charter prior to geometry hardening.

[2026-02-07] ATB AO governance alignment reviews require explicit confirmation of compliance with expansion doctrine and documentation of any variances requiring ARCHITECT approval.
