[2026-02-09] Phase 1 hydrogen production is canonically set at 1,000 metric tons per day (2 × 500 t/day per PFT) .
[2026-02-09] The BESS system in Phase 1 is a three-tier architecture totaling 725 MWh / 670 MW, split into fast, medium, and long-duration energy storage tiers .
[2026-02-09] Biomass power generation in Phase 1 is 167 MWe (2 × 83.3 MWe per PFT), with the biomass gasifier included in the FT EPC scope and the power block in a separate EPC scope .
[2026-02-09] Firm power capacity in Phase 1 totals ~2,607 MWe, composed of 2,200 MWe from nuclear, 167 MWe from biomass, 200 MWe from tail gas turbines, and 40 MWe from steam turbines .
[2026-02-09] Each AP1000 reactor delivers 1,100 MWe net; references to 1,150 MWe or gross figures are not canonical .
[2026-02-09] Ammonia is prohibited for Loop B or energy storage purposes; no NH₃ energy loop shall be present in Phase 1 or future plans .
[2026-02-09] Phase 1 financial model includes monetization of Section 45V hydrogen tax credits and Section 45Q carbon capture credits; expected combined value is ~$400M–$700M/year with conservative captive-use assumptions .
[2026-02-09] Five DSCR mitigation strategies are locked: (1) DSRA, (2) crossover financing, (3) bridge loans, (4) equity upsizing, and (5) tax credit monetization .
[2026-02-09] Phase 1 includes a contingency allocation of $1.0B in the CapEx breakdown .
[2026-02-09] Official Phase 1 timeline is: project development starts Q2 2026, financial close Q4 2028, and commercial operation (COD) in 2030 .
