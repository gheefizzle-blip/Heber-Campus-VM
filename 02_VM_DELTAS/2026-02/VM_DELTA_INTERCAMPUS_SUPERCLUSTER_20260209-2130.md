[2026-02-09] Decision confirmed to pursue owned dark fiber interconnecting Heber Campus and Holbrook Ranch Campus to operate as a single managed super-cluster with independent physical fault domains.

[2026-02-09] Architecture formalized for a ringed regional fiber topology: Winslow -> Holbrook -> Snowflake -> Show Low -> Heber -> Winslow, with multiple ingress and egress paths.

[2026-02-09] Determination made that owned fiber is a hard requirement for intercampus connectivity to support large-scale simulation, MECSAI refinement, advanced R&D, and future space operations.

[2026-02-09] Strategic expansion pathway identified along interstate-aligned fiber corridors, including I-80 regions (Elko NV, Ogden UT, Pocatello ID) with future eastward extension into Wyoming pending infrastructure validation.

[2026-02-09] Long-term objective formalized to integrate multiple campuses into a continent-scale super-massive cluster leveraging interstate fiber trunks.

[2026-02-09] Capital strategy defined to prioritize Tier 1 infrastructure asset managers as anchor partners capable of legitimizing and syndicating institutional investment.

[2026-02-09] Equity framework established anticipating surrender of approximately 20–35 percent ownership to secure an institutional anchor while retaining founder control.

[2026-02-09] Governance principle accepted that control is preserved through structure rather than absolute ownership percentage.

[2026-02-09] Decision made to defer political, institutional, and capital outreach until completion of engineering work, tax season obligations, and independent peer review.

[2026-02-09] Requirement established for peer technical review by qualified nuclear physicists prior to external engagement, recognizing future scale as one of the largest nuclear facility operators.

[2026-02-09] Long-term vision affirmed to pursue geosynchronous orbital fuel depots and shipyard infrastructure as downstream extensions of terrestrial energy and logistics dominance.
