## DELTA BEGIN

[2026-02-07] Geosynchronous orbit period (Earth-rotation-matched) is only achievable at GEO altitude (~35,786 km); "geosynchronous at 400 km" is not a free orbit and would require continuous thrust.
[2026-02-07] Reference orbital speeds: GEO circular orbital speed ~3.07 km/s; ~400 km circular LEO orbital speed ~7.7 km/s.
[2026-02-07] A vehicle at ~400 km altitude that co-rotates with Earth (ground-fixed longitude) would have tangential speed ~0.49 km/s and would require near-weight continuous thrust to avoid reentry.
[2026-02-07] Hover/ground-fixed operation between LEO and GEO for large masses is power-dominated and is not feasible under tens-of-megawatts-class NEP for ~100+ ton vehicles; orbital (elliptical/circular) dynamics are required for tug operations.
[2026-02-07] Heber Campus altitude basis: campus elevation ~6,500 ft (~2,000 m); 500 m launch tower places tube exit near ~2,500 m (~8,100 ft); SRM ignition criterion clarified as "10 km traveled after exit" (approx ignition altitude ~12.5 km ASL for vertical ascent).
[2026-02-07] Vertical ballistic ascent estimate: v_exit = 2.5 km/s (vertical, no SRM) yields ~318 km altitude gain (~320 km apogee class, ignoring drag).
[2026-02-07] Energy equivalence estimate: allocating LEO-class speed (~7.7 km/s) entirely to vertical ascent yields ~3,000 km apogee class (ignoring losses); reaching 10,000 km apogee via vertical ballistic ascent would require ~14 km/s vertical cutoff speed.
[2026-02-07] SRM sizing estimate (assumptions: 1.0 m diameter, 10 m length, propellant density ~1,700 kg/m^3, casing mass ~10% of propellant, Isp ~270 s): prop mass ~13.3 t; SRM delta-v ~5.0 km/s for a ~1 t pod + casing; combined with 2.5 km/s mag-lift supports low-thousands-km vertical apogee class (order ~2,000-3,000 km with losses).
[2026-02-07] SRM scaling estimate: doubling SRM length from 10 m to 20 m increases prop mass ~2x but delta-v only to ~5.6 km/s (logarithmic mass-ratio effect); vertical apogee remains in low-thousands-km class, not 10,000 km.
[2026-02-07] Tug rendezvous doctrine updated: tugs based at OSY-E in GEO must use transfer ellipses to intersect the pod corridor; rendezvous must be achieved by matching orbital states (low relative velocity), not by "hovering" in a vertical column.
[2026-02-07] OSY-E logistics concept (bulk): tug departs OSY-E (GEO) onto a GEO-perigee (LEO corridor) ellipse, collects pods into a matrix jig near perigee, then returns to OSY-E to deliver collected pods.
[2026-02-07] Sustainability constraint formalized for OSY-E prop production: tug chemical propellant is produced at OSY-E from delivered water; chemical propellant mass consumed per cycle must be <= 0.50 of delivered payload mass (0.25 preferred long-term for cost/kg over decade timescales).
[2026-02-07] Hybrid tug split model (GEO-LEO-GEO delta-v ~3.0 km/s): for chem:payload 0.50:1, chemical delta-v ~1.4 km/s and NEP delta-v ~1.6 km/s; for chem:payload 0.25:1, chemical delta-v ~0.76 km/s and NEP delta-v ~2.24 km/s; lower chemical fraction increases cycle time and required tug count for a fixed launch cadence.
[2026-02-07] Heber Launch Tower operational planning: nominal cadence 1 pod per 2.5 minutes; planning basis uses 75% duty cycle for maintenance/inspection resulting in ~400-450 launches per day.
[2026-02-07] OSY-E phase doctrine: OSY-E construction phases 1-4 operate as NEP-only logistics (dry construction materials) until water storage/processing is commissioned; after OSY-E is water-ready, cargo mix shifts to majority water to build reserves and enable on-orbit fuel production.
[2026-02-07] Post-water operational option: ship NH3 pods to OSY-E as a hydrogen carrier (NH3 hydrogen mass fraction ~17.6% vs water ~11.1%); crack NH3 using on-orbit reactor waste heat to produce H2 (and N2) for downstream fuel synthesis (e.g., methane) after OSY-E water reserves and processing are established.
