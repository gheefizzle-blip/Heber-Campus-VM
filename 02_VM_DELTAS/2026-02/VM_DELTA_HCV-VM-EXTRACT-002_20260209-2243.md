[2026-02-09] The Phase 3 campus design formalizes a total of 12 Power-Fuels Trains (PFTs), each delivering 18,000 BPD, totaling ~100,000–108,000 BPD.
[2026-02-09] Each PFT is paired 1:1 with a Xe-100 High Temperature Gas-cooled Reactor (200 MWth), supplying a molten salt loop at 565°C.
[2026-02-09] Each PFT includes an AP1000 for 1.1 GWe electric generation, a SOEC stack producing 457 t/day H2 and ~3,650 t/day O2, and two 60 MW data centers.
[2026-02-09] CO₂ sourcing for the refinery process is locked to 90% DAC and 10% biomass with CO₂ buffer storage for 3–5 days of operation.
[2026-02-09] The DAC system uses waste heat from FT synthesis and data center cooling loops for sorbent regeneration; DAC electrical load is limited to air fans, vacuum pumps, and compression.
[2026-02-09] All major fired heaters and tail-gas turbines operate using oxy-combustion to simplify CO₂ capture and eliminate NOₓ formation.
[2026-02-09] Each PFT includes a 500 MWh BESS to stabilize power loads and respond to solar variance, alongside dedicated UPS systems per data center.
[2026-02-09] The refinery train consists of RWGS, Fischer-Tropsch, hydrocracking, and fractionation. Output per PFT is 12,000 bpd Diesel, 4,000 bpd Jet-A, 2,000 bpd LPG.
[2026-02-09] RWGS reactors operate at ~700°C; FT synthesis reactors operate at ~200°C; hydrocracking units operate at 350–400°C and >100 bar.
[2026-02-09] All O₂ from SOEC is routed for internal use (gasifier, combustors) or liquefied for sale; no venting permitted.
[2026-02-09] The refinery architecture mandates zero flaring; tail gas is recycled to FT or used in closed-loop combustion with full CO₂ recovery.
[2026-02-09] Total net electrical generation per PFT is ~1,282 MW; average load is ~1,196 MW, leaving ~86 MW export margin.
[2026-02-09] Each PFT occupies ~60–70 acres including process, SMR, BESS, and data center zones.
[2026-02-09] All PFTs are connected to a shared MVDC backbone with modular DC/DC converters; AC is used only for legacy and auxiliary subsystems.
[2026-02-09] Rev 3.0 of ASG-HC-REFINERY-001 is now the authoritative Volume VI companion document and supersedes all previous versions.
[2026-02-09] The Heber campus expands in phases: Phase 1 = 2 PFTs, Phase 2 = 4 PFTs, Phase 3 = 6 PFTs, up to 12 in Phase 5, with train layout spacing at 500 ft.
[2026-02-09] Water usage is minimized by recycling condensate from FT and RWGS back into the SOEC steam feed loop.
