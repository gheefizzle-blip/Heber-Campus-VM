[2026-02-08] DC cooling architecture selected: closed-loop geothermal borefield + modular central NH3 cooling plant with N+1; control priority: free cooling first, geothermal second, compressors last.

[2026-02-08] HRWL (Heat Recovery Water Loop) doctrine formalized: isolated HX-only heat recovery loop with thermal buffer tank; heat distribution limited to pre-approved Heat Sink Registry; MECSAI may only allocate among registered sinks and may not alter topology.

[2026-02-08] Phase 2 operating and financial doctrine formalized as HC-PH2-001 Rev A (governance-binding): DC + solar led expansion; night treated as managed scarcity window; MECSAI enforces load shaping across DC/SOEC/chemical loads to avoid routine backup fuel use.

[2026-02-08] Phase 2 night load management targets set (planning): DC night deferrable IT 35-40%; SOEC night output 70-75% of average via current density modulation only (no thermal cycling); shift 10-20 MW chemical compression/transfer to daylight.

[2026-02-08] Phase 2 power export doctrine set (planning): firm export limit 50 MW 24/7 backed by SMR+biomass only; flexible exports primarily daytime; no firm export shall force SOEC reduction or fuel burn.

[2026-02-08] Firm vs flexible power sales posture defined by phase (planning): Phase 1 firm 25 MW; Phase 2 firm 50 MW; Phase 3 firm 75 MW (max 100 MW); flexible exports primarily daytime.

[2026-02-08] Phase 3 expansion and scale doctrine formalized as HC-PH3-001 Rev A: expand to 16 DC buildings, up to 5 GW solar, up to 100,000 bpd fuels, and modular SMR/SOEC replication gated by Phase 2 performance triggers.

[2026-02-08] Global 100-year roadmap formalized (conceptual, non-binding): Heber (AZ) proof-of-concept → Interior West replication (NV, ID, UT, WY) → coastal global deployments → OSY orbital integration → lunar/mars extension; fossil fuels decline in dependence but not assumed eliminated.

[2026-02-08] Data center phasing doctrine confirmed: DC buildings commissioned sequentially (1 → 2 → 4 in Phase 1–3; growth toward 16 in Phase 3) based on demand; DC loads modeled as variable via PUE and workload shifting.

[2026-02-08] Biomass feedstock planning basis recorded (Phase 1–2 context): biomass plant fuel requirement stated as 7,000 tons/day dry mass at ~$6/ton purchase price (stress-test ranges to be used later).

[2026-02-08] Coastal deployment option recorded: coastal Heber-class sites may use seawater desalination for industrial/process water supply; water sales to local infrastructure treated as additional revenue stream when desal is overbuilt.

[2026-02-08] Phase 3 carbon sourcing treated as long-horizon variable; working planning split adopted for modeling only: 40% biogenic CO2 capture, 20% fermentation CO2, 40% DAC; required CO2 scale for 100,000 bpd modeled at ~40,000 t/day total.

[2026-02-08] Revenue strategy doctrine clarified: refined fuels and data centers treated as primary profit engines; power exports treated as stabilizing backbone; firm power commitments kept small with optional flexible upside products.
