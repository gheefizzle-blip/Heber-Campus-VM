## HeberCampus VM Extract — Steam & SOEC Water Chemistry, Vendor Doctrine, and Execution Constraints

[2026-02-08] Formal acceptance standard for steam and SOEC-grade water chemistry established as procurement, FAT/SAT, insurer, and warranty gate; chemistry limits, sampling locations, materials compatibility, corrosion monitoring, and enforcement language defined.

[2026-02-08] Vendor compliance checklist doctrine established requiring modular scalability from Phase 1 through Phase 3 without chemistry envelope change, system redesign, or warranty reset; applies to SOEC systems and balance-of-plant.

[2026-02-08] Water purification vendors formally bound to modular Phase 1–Phase 3 expansion doctrine; purification systems required to scale via modular skid replication while maintaining SOEC-grade outlet chemistry and warranty continuity.

[2026-02-08] Explicit separation doctrine reinforced: VM extraction and canonical governance operations must be executed in retrieval-only context; file-generation and sandboxed execution contexts are non-authoritative for VM mutation.

[2026-02-08] Execution constraint acknowledged: sandboxed file-generation sessions are non-authoritative for external canonical retrieval; governance process requires isolation of VM extraction from document generation workflows.
