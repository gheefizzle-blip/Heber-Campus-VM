[2026-02-09] Decision: Initial hydrogen production backbone will use insured, warrantied, large-scale SOEC systems; experimental or internally developed SOEC hardware is prohibited from production loops.

[2026-02-09] Decision: Topsoe selected as front-runner SOEC vendor for Phase 1 due to availability of long-term service warranties and performance insurance.

[2026-02-09] Architecture Rule: Production operations and R&D systems must be physically, electrically, thermally, and contractually isolated.

[2026-02-09] Decision: Internal R&D division will be established to develop custom large-scale SOEC stacks for internal deployment and future external product sales.

[2026-02-09] Architecture Principle: Future refinery architecture is defined as power-paired by default; refineries without dedicated power generation are considered obsolete.

[2026-02-09] Decision: Nuclear reactor development will be pursued as a purpose-built design optimized for continuous SOEC operation, process heat delivery, and DC-first integration.

[2026-02-09] Architecture Principle: Reactor and SOEC systems will be co-designed to eliminate electric steam superheating via high-grade thermal integration.

[2026-02-09] Decision: Molten salt thermal loops are designated as the preferred temperature conditioning mechanism to achieve precise SOEC inlet steam- temperature control.

[2026-02-09] Constraint: Electric resistance heaters are disfavored for SOEC steam temperature elevation and should be eliminated where nuclear thermal conditioning is available.

[2026-02-09] Definition: Phase 3 production target formally defined as 100,000 barrels per day of synthetic hydrocarbon fuel equivalent.

[2026-02-09] Definition: Phase 3 hydrogen demand for 100,000 BPD synthetic hydrocarbon production is approximately 5,500 metric tons per day.

[2026-02-09] Architecture Rule: Planning-scale production unit defined as a paired block of approximately 1 GWe nuclear-electric output dedicated to SOEC.

[2026-02-09] Definition: One 1 GWe reactor-plus-SOEC block is expected to support approximately 12,000–13,000 BPD of synthetic hydrocarbon production.

[2026-02-09] Phase Impact: Achieving Phase 3 capacity of 100,000 BPD requires deployment of approximately eight 1 GWe reactor-plus-SOEC blocks.

[2026-02-09] Governance Rule: Internal technology graduation from R&D to production requires multi-year operational validation against insured baselines.
