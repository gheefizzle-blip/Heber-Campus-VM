[2026-02-09] A compliance-first Regulatory and Compliance Library architecture was formally adopted, requiring regulation to lead engineering rather than post-design compliance remediation.

[2026-02-09] A governed regulatory repository root was fixed at Z:\SE_T1\REGULATORY as the sole authoritative source for engineering compliance inputs.

[2026-02-09] A mandatory directory taxonomy for regulatory materials was established, partitioned by NRC core, federal environmental, Arizona state, grid and pipeline, occupational safety, logistics, and datacenter/cyber domains.

[2026-02-09] A policy was established that engineering agents have read-only access to the regulatory library, with write authority restricted to governance and compliance roles.

[2026-02-09] A requirement was formalized that every regulatory document stored must include a machine-readable metadata sidecar containing provenance and integrity fields.

[2026-02-09] Paywalled standards bodies (NFPA, API, ASME, TIA, ASHRAE) were designated index-only, prohibiting storage of proprietary content while preserving authoritative references.

[2026-02-09] A remediation and certification process was approved to replace stub or partial CFR and NRC documents with full authoritative editions prior to engineering reliance.

[2026-02-09] A deterministic certification standard was defined requiring full-content verification, minimum page-count thresholds, checksum validation, and elimination of temporary artifacts.

[2026-02-09] A regulatory baseline pinning doctrine was adopted, requiring engineering to reference a fixed CFR edition while monitoring updates separately.

[2026-02-09] A three-layer regulatory control model was established: pinned baseline for engineering, monitored delta stream for changes, and governance-led impact evaluation before baseline updates.

[2026-02-09] Continuous CFR change monitoring was approved using Federal Register notices, GovInfo CFR releases, and agency rulemaking feeds without automatic baseline mutation.
