## Phase 1 Energy Architecture, SOEC Procurement, Nuclear Scaling, & DC Bus Portability

[2026-02-08] Phase 1 energy architecture is constrained to commercially insurable nuclear reactors and commercially deployed SOEC systems to satisfy insurance, lender, and regulatory requirements.

[2026-02-08] Phase 1 SOEC procurement is limited to established vendors with fielded commercial systems; internal SOEC designs are explicitly excluded from production deployment in Phase 1.

[2026-02-08] Internal SOEC development is authorized as a parallel R&D activity beginning in Phase 2 and is prohibited from replacing commercial SOEC capacity without third-party validation and operating hours.

[2026-02-08] A campus-wide DC main bus architecture is established as a long-term design requirement to support direct coupling of nuclear, solar, storage, and electrolyzer systems.

[2026-02-08] The DC main bus architecture is designated as a portability requirement for future off-world and orbital system deployment.

[2026-02-08] Phase 3 nuclear scaling strategy adopts a mixed-reactor model combining large Gen III+ reactors with SMRs to reduce outage risk and maintenance-driven downtime.

[2026-02-08] Large reactor deployment is deferred until Phase 3, contingent on established storage capacity and load-following via hydrogen production.

[2026-02-08] Electrolyzer capacity scaling is defined at the plant-train level using modular hotbox units rather than monolithic single-stack systems.

[2026-02-08] Reduction of SMR unit count at multi-gigawatt scale is an accepted operational objective to lower staffing, containment, and maintenance complexity.
