[2026-02-09] Established "Nuclear Citadel Layout Doctrine" for multi-unit AP1000 deployments, defining each AP1000 as an independent Nuclear Unit Island with no shared safety systems.

[2026-02-09] Formalized minimum inter-unit separation requirement of >=500 ft basemat-edge to basemat-edge between AP1000 Nuclear Unit Islands to prevent common-cause hazards.

[2026-02-09] Adopted requirement that each AP1000 Nuclear Unit Island include a full perimeter loop road providing two-directional emergency access and at least two independent site egress routes.

[2026-02-09] Locked master electrical topology requiring a 30 kV MVDC backbone implemented as a full perimeter ring outside the Nuclear Citadel, with no MVDC corridors routed through the interior unit field.

[2026-02-09] Defined MVDC connection rules: each AP1000 connects to the MVDC ring via a dedicated lateral with hardware fault isolation at both unit and ring interfaces; no shared laterals permitted.

[2026-02-09] Established turbine building orientation constraint requiring credible turbine missile trajectories to avoid reactor containments, MCR buildings, MVDC ring nodes, and emergency access corridors.

[2026-02-09] Approved paired Main Control Room (MCR) facility concept: two fully independent MCR safety bunkers housed within a single building envelope for non-safety facility sharing only.

[2026-02-09] Formalized allowed shared MCR-adjacent spaces (parking, lobby, breakrooms, bathrooms, training) and prohibited sharing of all safety power, HVAC, I&C, habitability, and fire zones.

[2026-02-09] Defined Nuclear Citadel industrial exclusion rule prohibiting hydrogen, ammonia, fuels, DAC, and hazardous industrial facilities within the Nuclear Citadel boundary.

[2026-02-09] Established planning-scale dimensioned block layout for a 12-unit AP1000 Nuclear Citadel using two linear rows of six units separated by a central service corridor, supporting fleet construction and phased commissioning.
