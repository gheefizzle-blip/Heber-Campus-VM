## DELTA BEGIN

[2026-02-09] MECSAI adopts a layered, warranty-safe equipment monitoring doctrine using non-invasive external sensors as the default outer layer.
[2026-02-09] Vendor integrations for SOEC and balance-of-plant systems are constrained to read-only data access with no write privileges.
[2026-02-09] External monitoring is prohibited from modifying vendor firmware, control logic, wiring harnesses, or pressure boundaries.
[2026-02-09] Clamp-on, adhesive, magnetic, infrared, acoustic, and external electrical sensors are defined as the approved monitoring boundary.
[2026-02-09] MECSAI normalizes all equipment telemetry into a unified tag schema with units, ranges, sampling rates, and criticality levels.
[2026-02-09] Degradation detection is formally defined to include thermal delta drift, specific energy creep, cell voltage dispersion, vibration spectral growth, and duty-cycle creep.
[2026-02-09] Asset response states are formalized as Yellow (inspect), Orange (derate), and Red (controlled shutdown with vendor notification).
[2026-02-09] Warranty preservation requires documented installation methods, independent power and data paths, and written vendor acknowledgment for read-only exports.
