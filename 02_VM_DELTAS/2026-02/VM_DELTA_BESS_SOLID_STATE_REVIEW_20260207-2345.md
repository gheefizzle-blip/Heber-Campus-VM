[2026-02-07] Appendix B "BESS Technology Selection and Bankability Doctrine" approved for HC-MGD-001, establishing financeability, insurability, and price as mandatory gating criteria for utility-scale battery system selection.

[2026-02-07] Heber Campus BESS program formally constrained to bankable and insurable battery technologies only; experimental or non-financeable chemistries (including all-solid-state) excluded from Phase 1 and Phase 2 deployment eligibility.

[2026-02-07] Utility-scale all-solid-state battery systems explicitly categorized as non-commercial and non-deployable for current Heber Campus phases due to lack of insurance underwriting and project finance acceptance.

[2026-02-07] Vendor selection process authorized to proceed using normalized pricing comparisons ($/kWh and $/kW turnkey), with price weighted as a primary decision factor alongside safety certification and warranty structure.
