[2026-02-09] Helium is designated as a procured industrial utility for the Heber Campus; on-site helium production or recovery is explicitly excluded from baseline design.

[2026-02-09] Helium use is limited to closed-loop heat transfer for high-temperature nuclear reactors and downstream superheating; helium is not treated as a consumable, energy storage medium, or revenue product.

[2026-02-09] Helium recovery from natural gas streams is rejected for Phase 1 through Phase 3 due to unfavorable CAPEX/OPEX relative to purchased helium unless future gas assays demonstrate >0.1 percent helium concentration.

[2026-02-09] Optional helium recovery evaluation is deferred to Phase 3+ only and gated by verified helium-bearing gas supply, economic thresholds, and non-interference with critical path execution.

[2026-02-09] Hybrid thermal architecture preference is confirmed: helium-to-salt heat transfer for bulk thermal duty with helium-to-steam superheating to achieve 780-820C SOEC inlet temperatures, eliminating large electric superheat parasitics.

[2026-02-09] Strategic priority is established to eliminate approximately 500 MW of electric superheat load to preserve dispatchable electric capacity for revenue-generating uses.
