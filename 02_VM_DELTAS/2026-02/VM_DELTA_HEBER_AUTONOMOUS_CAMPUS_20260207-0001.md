[2026-02-07] Battery storage is defined as 500 MWh BESS for peak load support, ramping, and black-start assist.
[2026-02-07] A SOEC block is defined to produce hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) from electricity.
[2026-02-07] Hydrogen is defined to be converted to ammonia (NH3) for stable bulk storage and dispatchable energy use.
[2026-02-07] A tank farm is defined with bulkheads and loading for both O2 and NH3 to truck tankers and railcars.
[2026-02-07] Gas turbines are defined to operate on an NH3 and O2 mix (oxy-combustion intent).
[2026-02-07] NuScale SMR integration is defined as 3 modules at 77 MW each, included in the master plan but expected to be the longest-lead item due to regulatory/environmental timelines.
[2026-02-07] A terrestrial data center is defined as the backbone of MECSAI (campus master control and orchestration).
[2026-02-07] Primary water supply is defined as the Coconino aquifer, subject to permitting and safeguards.
[2026-02-07] Manufacturing facilities are defined for Autonomous House production with multiple models.
[2026-02-07] Manufacturing facilities are defined for space assets (space tugs, SDCs, comms modules) including clean room environments.
[2026-02-07] A 500 meter vertical mag-lift launch building is defined on campus with a dedicated safety zone.
[2026-02-07] A rail spur connection from BNSF is defined, with a campus rail yard supporting bulk product loading.
[2026-02-07] Truck tanker access roads are defined with a scale house for tare and loaded weight.
[2026-02-07] Security is defined as guarded entry with guard shack, cameras, and 8 ft perimeter fencing with razor wire tops.
[2026-02-07] An on-site airport is defined with a full taxiway, a primary runway and a crosswind runway, with 9,000 ft runway length basis, plus a helipad.
[2026-02-07] A ground-based communications station is defined for redundancy to satellite communications cycles.
[2026-02-07] Fiber trunk connectivity is defined for facility backhaul via the regional backbone installed through the area.
[2026-02-07] A housing complex is defined to support 600 residents with a rec center (weights/cardio/basketball), general store, pharmacy, casual dining, and mixed unit types (studio/1BR/2BR).
[2026-02-07] Wind direction is a primary placement constraint; provisional prevailing wind basis is SW to NE pending met-mast confirmation.
[2026-02-07] Launch tower is explicitly required to be as far from other infrastructure as practical and to be isolated by a safety exclusion zone.
[2026-02-07] Launch tower zoning is defined with an exclusion radius increased to 1,800 ft and placed near the far NW portion of the site in the working coordinate plan.
[2026-02-07] Ammonia is defined as an integrated campus cooling agent for facility climate control and data center cooling.
[2026-02-07] Data center cooling architecture is defined to keep NH3 out of occupied IT halls by using central NH3 plants and secondary glycol/brine distribution loops.
[2026-02-07] Waste-heat-driven absorption chilling (NH3/H2O) is defined as part of the campus thermal integration plan.
[2026-02-07] A chilled-water thermal energy storage concept is defined to provide 6-10 hours of N+1 data hall cooling resilience.
[2026-02-07] Campus design is defined to be modular with flexible interconnections for power, water, and communications via standardized corridors and nodes.
[2026-02-07] MECSAI control architecture is defined as modular cell-level control with feedback to a master control layer; safety interlocks remain on hard PLC and are not bypassable by MECSAI.
[2026-02-07] A0 master site plan is defined as ARCH E (36x48) with base scale 1 inch equals 400 feet, with insets at 1 inch equals 200 feet for dense blocks, and a local SW-origin coordinate grid (500 ft major / 100 ft minor).
