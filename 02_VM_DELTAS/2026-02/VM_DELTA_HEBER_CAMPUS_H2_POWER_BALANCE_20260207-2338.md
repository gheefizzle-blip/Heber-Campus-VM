[2026-02-07] Heber Campus design target: 1.5 GW deliverable during daylight hours via PV generation across ~8,000 acres of photovoltaic cells.

[2026-02-07] Heber Campus power profile is non-binary; solar output ramps up in the morning and ramps down in the evening, requiring dynamic (hourly) modeling rather than on/off assumptions.

[2026-02-07] Heber Campus must sustain operations through seasonal daylight variation (winter shorter, summer longer); non-solar production hours are variable by time of year.

[2026-02-07] Heber Campus requires a storage buffer sized to cover approximately 10 consecutive days of low solar production.

[2026-02-07] Overnight demand is expected to be lower than daytime demand; overnight deliverable requirement must be based on real-world Arizona regional load data rather than assumed fixed percentages.

[2026-02-07] Baseline overnight firm generation includes four SMR units (80 MW electric each when in electric mode) plus a biomass plant (~100 MW), for approximately 420 MW continuous overnight baseline generation when all are dispatched electrically.

[2026-02-07] Biomass plant operates 24/7 and continuously produces both electricity and steam; steam can be routed to SOECs at any hour.

[2026-02-07] Each SMR unit can be dispatched between ~80 MW electric output and ~200 MW thermal output; thermal dispatch can support steam production for SOEC feed.

[2026-02-07] Hydrogen production is required to operate fuel cells and turbines during non-solar production hours to meet deliverable power requirements beyond baseline firm generation.

[2026-02-07] Heber Campus hydrogen system must support both energy storage needs (overnight and low-solar periods) and petrochemical operations, including combining captured carbon (from biomass CO2 capture) with hydrogen for synthetic fuels (propane, diesel, kerosene, etc.).

[2026-02-07] Operational concept includes producing hydrogen during daylight using PV-powered SOEC electrical input and considering limited nighttime hydrogen production using SMR electric dispatch to partially power SOECs, reducing daily storage drawdown.
