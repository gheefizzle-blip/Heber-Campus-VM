[2026-02-09] Determined that biomass gasification alone cannot reliably supply required carbon for 18,000 bpd synthetic fuel production under all operating conditions.

[2026-02-09] Established that supplemental CO2 capture is structurally required to maintain 110 percent carbon availability as mandated by HC-MGD-001.

[2026-02-09] Defined Direct Air Capture (DAC) as the only non-fossil pathway capable of closing the projected carbon shortfall at Heber Campus scale.

[2026-02-09] Set engineering planning basis for supplemental CO2 capacity at approximately 1,500 to 3,000 metric tons per day.

[2026-02-09] Formally designated DAC systems as process utilities, not revenue-generating assets, within campus architecture.

[2026-02-09] Established carbon capture tiering doctrine: biomass gasification as primary carbon source, DAC as makeup carbon, flue-gas capture as optimization layer.

[2026-02-09] Accepted industrial-scale DAC architectures (liquid solvent class) as baseload-capable; rejected small-scale or pilot-only DAC systems as insufficient for primary makeup duty.

[2026-02-09] Mandated that external CO2 systems shall not become single points of failure and shall not dictate upstream process design.

[2026-02-09] Locked requirement that DAC and CO2 capture loads be dispatchable based on internal power availability and not constrain primary energy systems.
