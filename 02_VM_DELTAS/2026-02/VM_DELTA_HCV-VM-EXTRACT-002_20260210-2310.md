[2026-02-10] Decision established to pursue a staged **Phase 0-A activation strategy** to bridge from personal capital to institutional seed funding, explicitly deferring full Phase 0 execution until external partner capital is secured.

[2026-02-10] Phase 0-A scope formally constrained to: (1) Delaware C-Corp formation for Atlas Systems Group, (2) Arizona-based land targeting and nuclear envelope definition for BLM engagement, and (3) informal, non-filing intent briefings to NRC and DOE; all NEPA, ROW filing, and environmental field work explicitly deferred.

[2026-02-10] Phase 0-A personal capital envelope defined at approximately USD 30k–40k, intended solely to unlock strategic partners rather than complete regulatory activation.

[2026-02-10] Governance decision adopted to structure Atlas Systems Group as a **Delaware C-Corp holding company**, with project- and function-specific subsidiaries to be created later; Atlas Systems Group designated as the sole early-facing entity for BLM, NRC, DOE, and capital discussions.

[2026-02-10] Legal engagement strategy ratified requiring **dual counsel**: Delaware counsel for corporate formation, governance, cap table, and registered agent duties; Arizona counsel for land use, BLM interface, and state-level permitting alignment; single-firm consolidation explicitly rejected.

[2026-02-10] Early-capital strategy revised to prioritize **strategic development partners** (family offices, industrial HNW, infrastructure-aligned capital) over lenders, with seed capital characterized as development equity or equity-like instruments.

[2026-02-10] Timeline expectation formalized that Phase 0-A initiation to committed seed capital is realistically 4–6 months under normal execution, with <3 months deemed exceptional and >9 months treated as a failure condition.
