[2026-02-09] Full Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) is mandatory for the Heber Campus project due to nuclear scale, cumulative impacts, water withdrawal, and multi-agency federal action; avoiding an EIS is not a viable or defensible path.

[2026-02-09] Accepted strategy is a single Programmatic Master EIS covering ultimate buildout, with all phases and subprojects tiered beneath it; segmentation or EA-only approaches are explicitly rejected due to litigation and financing risk.

[2026-02-09] Target pre-development capital requirement to reach financeable Phase 1 construction readiness is approximately USD 8-10 million over 18-24 months.

[2026-02-09] Early-stage capital required for EIS launch and permitting must be development equity or equity-like instruments; straight debt is not feasible prior to permits, revenues, or offtake.

[2026-02-09] Government grants cannot fully fund early NEPA and EIS work; realistic grant offset is approximately 20-40 percent and is reimbursable, scoped, and sequenced after private capital commitment.

[2026-02-09] Correct capital sequencing is: development equity sponsors first, sovereign and federal lenders second, strategic offtake partners last; reversing this order materially increases project failure risk.

[2026-02-09] Engagement with nuclear vendors (e.g., reactor suppliers) may begin in parallel with NEPA and EIS execution via non-binding MOUs or slot-reservation frameworks; binding purchase orders are deferred until regulatory approvals and financing milestones.

[2026-02-09] Data center demand and hyperscaler interest function as later-stage credit enhancement and offtake leverage, not as early-stage lenders or development capital sources.
