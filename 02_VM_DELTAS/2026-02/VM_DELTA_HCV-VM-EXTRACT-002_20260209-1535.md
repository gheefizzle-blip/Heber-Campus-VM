[2026-02-09] Ammonia (NH3) is formally designated as a long-duration energy storage asset for the campus, functioning as a hydrogen energy reserve capable of sustaining campus operations during multi-day renewable shortfall events (e.g., winter storms, monsoon conditions).

[2026-02-09] Phase 1 design requires ammonia storage capacity sufficient to support a minimum 10-day autonomy period under worst-case low-solar conditions, with NH3 available for cracking to hydrogen for power generation and plant operations.

[2026-02-09] Hydrogen production architecture is defined as a three-leg system consisting of PEM electrolyzers, SOEC electrolyzers, and ammonia cracking, with N+1 resilience such that loss of any single leg does not interrupt minimum campus operations.

[2026-02-09] Installed hydrogen production capacities must satisfy the constraints: PEM + SOEC >= minimum required hydrogen demand; PEM + NH3 cracking >= minimum required hydrogen demand; SOEC + NH3 cracking >= minimum required hydrogen demand.

[2026-02-09] Campus operational doctrine establishes a "must-run island" load definition that takes priority over all external power export obligations during constrained generation events.

[2026-02-09] Electrical export contracts shall include explicit curtailment or suspension provisions during defined storm or low-renewable conditions, ensuring campus operations are never subordinated to export commitments.

[2026-02-09] Ammonia cracking capacity is required to support both hydrogen supply for fuels production and electrical power generation via fuel cells and turbines during renewable shortfall events.
