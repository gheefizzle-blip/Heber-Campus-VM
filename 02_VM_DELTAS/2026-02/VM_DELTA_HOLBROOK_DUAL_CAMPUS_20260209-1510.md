[2026-02-09] Holbrook Ranch identified as a viable secondary campus capable of full duplication of Heber Campus core functions, including energy generation, fuels production, fertilizer production, data centers, and R&D, contingent on water and rights verification.

[2026-02-09] Holbrook Ranch parcels totaling approximately 30,000+ acres confirmed as contiguous or adjacent and held under a single trust ownership, materially reducing land assembly risk and enabling unified industrial zoning.

[2026-02-09] Active rail right-of-way crossing Holbrook Ranch parcels confirmed as a strategic logistics asset enabling bulk inbound and outbound transport without third-party industrial park dependency.

[2026-02-09] Holbrook Ranch designated as a strategic fallback site to mitigate federal land (BLM/USFS) permitting risk associated with Heber Campus.

[2026-02-09] Governance position established that Holbrook Ranch may function as a peer campus rather than a satellite, with potential specialization toward fertilizer, bulk materials, biomass processing, and logistics-heavy operations.

[2026-02-09] Decision boundary defined for Holbrook Ranch acquisition: acquisition remains viable below an aggregate purchase price threshold of approximately $50–60M, assuming clean title, intact mineral rights, controlled rail access, and viable water rights.

[2026-02-09] Acquisition price bands defined as internal decision framework: strong-buy below ~$15M, acceptable with negotiation ~$15–30M, conditional ~$30–50M, no-go above ~$50M unless Heber Campus execution is materially constrained.

[2026-02-09] Strategic doctrine established that land price alone is not a disqualifier; loss of operational control, mineral rights, water access, or rail rights constitutes a hard no-go condition regardless of purchase price.

[2026-02-09] Dual-campus operating model formalized as enabling modular redundancy, phased replication, and market-driven specialization between Heber Campus and Holbrook Ranch.
