## DELTA BEGIN

[2026-02-09] Phase 0 hydrogeology feasibility shall evaluate two candidate sites in parallel: Heber (BLM-adjacent) and Holbrook Ranch (fee land), using a shared regional baseline with site-specific addenda.

[2026-02-09] Dual-site Phase 0 hydrogeology strategy approved to preserve project optionality, reduce single-site risk, and improve early funding leverage.

[2026-02-09] Holbrook Ranch identified as an alternate candidate site with material infrastructure adjacency advantages including interstate highway access, rail access, natural gas transmission proximity, major fiber trunk proximity, and surface water adjacency.

[2026-02-09] If Phase 0 hydrogeology confirms both sites are viable, Holbrook Ranch becomes the preferred site for early partner capital engagement due to fee-simple land control and reduced federal sequencing risk.

[2026-02-09] Early capital strategy updated: leverage dual-site viability to secure early partner funding for land control (option or acquisition) of Holbrook Ranch prior to full project seed financing.
