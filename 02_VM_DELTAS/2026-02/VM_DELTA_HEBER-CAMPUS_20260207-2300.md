## DELTA BEGIN

[2026-02-07] OSY bulk logistics concept accepted: high-cadence mass-to-LEO supply is required primarily for raw building materials (steel, aluminum, tools, assembly parts), not sensitive payloads.
[2026-02-07] Mag-lift architecture constraint accepted: stratospheric sky-ramp is rejected as impractical; vertical vacuum launch shaft (VVLS) selected as feasible path.
[2026-02-07] VVLS operational rule accepted: vehicle exits vertically and must ignite immediately after tube exit to prevent fall-back; tug rendezvous is used after orbital insertion/intercept.
[2026-02-07] Payload handling constraint accepted: cargo (raw materials) can tolerate up to ~100 g; rocket guidance/propulsion hardware is the limiting component for g-loading.
[2026-02-07] KISS propulsion decision accepted: bolt-on solid rocket motor(s) preferred for simplicity and reliability (fewer failure points).
[2026-02-07] Mag-lift target updated: initial target exit velocity 500 m/s; revised target to 700 m/s when using high-g-tolerant solid motor approach.
[2026-02-07] Example facility concept accepted: 500 m concrete/steel launch tower with 4 vertical mag-lift shafts plus service elevator/stair access; sabot/sled concept incorporated.
[2026-02-07] Site concept expanded: campus-integrated power generation adjacent to launch complex; capacitor/supercap-only approach deprioritized in favor of staged energy storage with recharge between launches.
[2026-02-07] Island siting option recorded: Hawaii or Guam considered for remoteness and over-ocean safety corridors; logistics tradeoffs acknowledged.
[2026-02-07] Inland siting option recorded: Overgaard, AZ (~6,000 ft elevation) considered due to sparse population, available land, rail/highway access, labor availability; elevation noted as reducing muzzle dynamic pressure proportionally to air density.
[2026-02-07] Integrated campus scope accepted: include power generation, hydrogen production at scale, solar farm, data center/SDC test center, and manufacturing facilities as a unified ecosystem.
[2026-02-07] Grid strategy accepted: excess campus power export to grid is a revenue stream; regional coal retirements referenced as market pull for new firm capacity.
[2026-02-07] Space comms resilience requirement accepted: establish a ground comms node on campus to reduce reliance on commercial LEO internet constellations.
[2026-02-07] Campus land planning baseline recorded: core developed area estimated ~3,400 acres; total land acquisition target ~8,000–12,000 acres to preserve buffers and expansion.
[2026-02-07] Private airport requirement accepted: on-site private airport included; high-elevation runway length target ~9,000–9,500 ft with associated safety areas.
[2026-02-07] Staff housing requirement accepted: on-site small apartment complex for staff; Phase A baseline defined as 120 units with expansion pad reserved to scale to ~300 units.
[2026-02-07] Housing Phase A program recorded: 40 studios, 60 one-bed, 20 two-bed; site take ~7 acres Phase A plus ~7 acres reserved for Phase B; parking planning ~1.3 stalls/unit with EV and accessible allocation.
[2026-02-07] Aquifer note recorded: Overgaard-area siting is stated to overlie the Coconino aquifer; groundwater-assisted cooling is identified as a campus design consideration.
