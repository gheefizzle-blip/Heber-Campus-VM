## DELTA BEGIN

[2026-02-07] Heber Campus nuclear island baseline pivot approved-in-principle from NuScale LWR SMR to pebble-bed HTGR (Xe-100 class) to align terrestrial operations with OSY-E reactor doctrine and to maximize Earth-to-orbit operational learning transfer.
[2026-02-07] Heber Campus Master Plan requires revision to reflect HTGR baseline and associated nuclear island, thermal integration, controls, and licensing/fuel-supply risk posture updates.
[2026-02-07] OSY-E power conversion baseline preference set to closed Brayton-class conversion; Rankine steam/two-phase baselines in microgravity are treated as high-complexity/high-risk and not default.
[2026-02-07] OSY-E pebble-bed fuel handling identified as a gating issue: classic gravity-driven pebble circulation assumptions do not hold in microgravity.
[2026-02-07] OSY-E fuel-handling baseline recommendation set to Option B/C (static pebble campaign core with batch refuel OR prismatic TRISO HTGR) with helium primary retained; spin-gravity moving-pebble module is a conditional upgrade path; mechanical pebble recirculation in microgravity is not baselined due to reliability risk.
[2026-02-07] Spent fuel handling baseline for OSY-E set to shielded cask storage in a dedicated "nuclear yard" zone; spent fuel treated as shielding/ballast asset; deep-space/Jupiter disposal is not baselined.
[2026-02-07] HTGR heat integration baseline: do not "swap coolant" between water and ammonia; use helium primary with an Intermediate Heat Exchanger and dispatch heat to dedicated secondary loops (steam/SOEC steam train and NH3 feed preheat to cracker) with multi-barrier isolation and leak detection.
[2026-02-07] Night operations leg concept updated: residual fuel cell anode purge/off-gas hydrogen may be routed to a dedicated catalytic oxidizer/burner for heat recovery and turbine hot-standby; it is not treated as primary turbine fuel due to variability and limited flow.
[2026-02-07] Safety rule locked for turbine integration: do not mix H2 and O2 in piping; mixing occurs only at a controlled combustor/burner under burner management and interlocks; pure O2/H2 firing requires dilution (e.g., steam injection or exhaust recycle) to protect turbine hardware.
[2026-02-07] ATB submission artifacts authored: HC-EN-NUC-PIVOT-DEC-001 Rev A, HC-EN-NUC-PIVOT-ADD-A-001 Rev A, HC-EN-NUC-PIVOT-ADD-B-001 Rev A.
