## Heber Autonomous Industrial Campus - Master Design

### Site Definition
- **Location:** North of Heber/Overgaard, Arizona
- **Size:** 1,200 acres total
- **Coordinate Grid:** SW-origin, 500 ft major / 100 ft minor intervals
- **Master Plan:** ARCH E format (36x48), base scale 1" = 400'; insets at 1" = 200' for dense zones

### Power System
- **Target:** 220 MW net, modular phased integration
- **Solar:** 40 MW farm (single-axis planning basis)
- **Battery Storage:** 500 MWh BESS for peak load support, ramping, black-start
- **SMR Integration:** 3x NuScale modules at 77 MW each (longest-lead regulatory item)

### Energy Production & Storage
- **SOEC Block:** Produces H₂ and O₂ from electricity
- **Ammonia Conversion:** H₂ converted to NH₃ for bulk storage and dispatchable energy
- **Tank Farm:** Bulkheads and loading for O₂ and NH₃ to truck tankers and railcars
- **Gas Turbines:** NH₃ and O₂ mix (oxy-combustion)

### Cooling Architecture
- **Ammonia Role:** Integrated campus cooling agent for climate control and data center cooling
- **Distribution:** Central NH₃ plants with secondary glycol/brine loops (NH₃ excluded from occupied IT halls)
- **Waste-Heat Recovery:** Absorption chilling (NH₃/H₂O) integrated into thermal plan
- **Thermal Storage:** Chilled-water system provides 6-10 hours N+1 data hall cooling resilience

### Water & Environmental
- **Primary Supply:** Coconino aquifer (subject to permitting and safeguards)
- **Wind Constraint:** Provisional prevailing wind direction SW to NE (pending met-mast confirmation)

### Data Center & Control
- **MECSAI System:** Terrestrial data center as backbone for campus master control and orchestration
- **Architecture:** Modular cell-level control with feedback to master control layer
- **Safety Interlocks:** Hard PLC-based, non-bypassable by MECSAI

### Manufacturing
- **Autonomous Houses:** Multiple models (on-site production)
- **Space Assets:** Space tugs, SDCs, communications modules (includes clean room environments)

### Launch Infrastructure
- **Vertical Mag-Lift Building:** 500 m height with dedicated safety zone
- **Launch Tower Zoning:** Exclusion radius 1,800 ft, placed far NW portion of site
- **Requirement:** Isolated as far from other infrastructure as practical

### Transportation & Access
- **Rail:** BNSF spur connection with campus rail yard for bulk product loading
- **Truck Access:** Dedicated tanker roads with scale house (tare/loaded measurement)
- **Airport:** Full taxiway, primary runway, crosswind runway (9,000 ft basis), plus helipad
- **Communications:** Fiber trunk backhaul via regional backbone; ground-based comms station for satellite redundancy

### Security
- **Perimeter:** 8 ft fencing with razor wire tops
- **Access:** Guarded entry with guard shack, camera system

### Residential & Support
- **Housing Complex:** 600-resident capacity
- **Amenities:** Rec center (weights/cardio/basketball), general store, pharmacy, casual dining
- **Units:** Mixed types (studio, 1BR, 2BR)

### Campus Design Philosophy
- **Modularity:** Flexible interconnections for power, water, communications via standardized corridors and nodes
