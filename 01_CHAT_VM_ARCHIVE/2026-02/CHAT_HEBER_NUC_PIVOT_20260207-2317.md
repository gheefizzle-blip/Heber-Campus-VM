## Heber Campus Nuclear Pivot - HTGR Baseline Adoption

### Reactor Selection
- **Baseline Pivot:** NuScale LWR SMR → Pebble-bed HTGR (Xe-100 class)
- **Rationale:** Align terrestrial operations with OSY-E reactor doctrine; maximize Earth-to-orbit operational learning transfer
- **Master Plan Impact:** Requires revision for nuclear island, thermal integration, controls, licensing/fuel-supply risk posture

### OSY-E Power Conversion
- **Baseline Preference:** Closed Brayton-class conversion
- **De-prioritized:** Rankine steam/two-phase in microgravity (high-complexity, high-risk)

### OSY-E Pebble-Bed Fuel Handling
- **Gating Issue:** Gravity-driven pebble circulation assumptions invalid in microgravity
- **Baseline Recommendation:** Option B/C selected
  - Static pebble campaign core with batch refuel, OR
  - Prismatic TRISO HTGR with helium primary retained
- **Conditional Upgrade:** Spin-gravity moving-pebble module is upgrade path only
- **Not Baselined:** Mechanical pebble recirculation in microgravity (reliability risk)

### OSY-E Spent Fuel Handling
- **Baseline:** Shielded cask storage in dedicated "nuclear yard" zone
- **Asset Class:** Spent fuel treated as shielding/ballast asset
- **Not Baselined:** Deep-space/Jupiter disposal

### HTGR Heat Integration
- **Prohibition Rule:** Do NOT swap coolant between water and ammonia
- **Primary Circuit:** Helium retained
- **Secondary Architecture:** Helium → Intermediate Heat Exchanger (IHX) → dedicated secondary loops
  - Steam/SOEC steam train
  - NH₃ feed preheat to cracker
- **Isolation:** Multi-barrier isolation with leak detection required

### Night Operations & Fuel Cell Integration
- **Anode Purge Routing:** Residual H₂ from fuel cell anode purge may route to dedicated catalytic oxidizer/burner
- **Heat Recovery:** Burner output feeds turbine hot-standby
- **Constraint:** NOT primary turbine fuel (variability, limited flow)

### Turbine Safety Rules (Locked)
- **Mixing Prohibition:** Do NOT mix H₂ and O₂ in piping
- **Controlled Combustion:** Mixing only at controlled combustor/burner with burner management and interlocks
- **Pure H₂/O₂ Firing:** Requires dilution (steam injection or exhaust recycle) to protect turbine materials
