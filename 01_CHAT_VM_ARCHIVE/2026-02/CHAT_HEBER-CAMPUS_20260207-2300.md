## Heber Campus VVLS Project - Initial Decisions (2026-02-07)

### Logistics & Payload Strategy
- High-cadence mass-to-LEO supply required primarily for raw building materials (steel, aluminum, tools, assembly parts), not sensitive payloads
- Raw cargo can tolerate up to ~100 g; rocket guidance/propulsion hardware is the limiting component

### Launch Architecture
- Stratospheric sky-ramp rejected as impractical
- **Vertical Vacuum Launch Shaft (VVLS)** selected as feasible path
- Vehicle exits vertically and must ignite immediately after tube exit to prevent fall-back
- Tug rendezvous used after orbital insertion/intercept
- Bolt-on solid rocket motors preferred for simplicity and reliability (fewer failure points)

### Mag-Lift Performance Targets
- Initial target exit velocity: 500 m/s
- Revised target: 700 m/s (with high-g-tolerant solid motor approach)

### Facility Concept
- 500 m concrete/steel launch tower with 4 vertical mag-lift shafts
- Service elevator/stair access
- Sabot/sled concept incorporated

### Campus Integration
- On-site power generation adjacent to launch complex
- Staged energy storage with recharge between launches (capacitor/supercap-only approach deprioritized)
- Hydrogen production at scale
- Solar farm
- Data center/SDC test center
- Manufacturing facilities as unified ecosystem
- Ground comms node for space resilience (reduce reliance on commercial LEO constellations)

### Grid & Revenue Strategy
- Excess campus power export to grid as revenue stream
- Regional coal retirements referenced as market pull for new firm capacity

### Site Options
**Island Siting:** Hawaii or Guam (remoteness, over-ocean safety corridors)

**Inland Siting:** Overgaard, AZ
- ~6,000 ft elevation
- Sparse population, available land
- Rail/highway access
- Labor availability
- Elevation reduces muzzle dynamic pressure proportionally to air density
- Overlie the Coconino aquifer (groundwater-assisted cooling identified as design consideration)

### Campus Land Planning
- Core developed area: ~3,400 acres
- Total acquisition target: ~8,000–12,000 acres (buffers + expansion)

### Private Airport
- On-site included
- High-elevation runway length target: ~9,000–9,500 ft with safety areas

### Staff Housing
- On-site apartment complex required
- **Phase A:** 120 units (40 studios, 60 one-bed, 20 two-bed)
- Phase A footprint: ~7 acres developed + ~7 acres reserved for Phase B
- Expansion potential to ~300 units
- Parking: ~1.3 stalls/unit with EV and accessible allocation
