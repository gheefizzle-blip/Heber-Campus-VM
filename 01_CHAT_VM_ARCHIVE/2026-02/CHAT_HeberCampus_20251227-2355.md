## Heber Campus Baseline Product Slate, Generation Capacity, & Expansion Envelope

### Baseline Liquid Fuels Production (Phase 1)
- **Total Capacity:** 18,000 bpd (barrels per day) liquids
  - Diesel: 12,000 bpd (66.7%)
  - Jet-A: 4,000 bpd (22.2%)
  - LPG: 2,000 bpd (11.1%)
- **Product Distribution:** Multi-product fuels enable diverse customer acquisition (aviation, trucking, agricultural equipment, industrial heating)
- **Feedstock:** Syngas from hydrogen + biomass-derived CO₂ routed through Fischer-Tropsch or similar catalytic synthesis
- **Market:** Merchant export after internal campus fuel requirements (VVLS, ground ops, data center fuel backup)

### Baseline Electrical Generation (Phase 1)
- **Nameplate Capacity:** 1.5 GW
- **Dispatch Priority:** Internal campus consumption (SOEC, data centers, VVLS launch prep, manufacturing, HVAC)
- **Surplus Capability:** Merchant export to regional grid during low-internal-load periods
- **Generation Mix:** PV (1.5 GW), SMR thermal (coupled with SOEC + biomass steam), battery storage (intra-day smoothing)
- **Revenue Model:** Premium pricing for off-peak solar export; potential grid services contracts (frequency regulation, etc.)

### Long-Term Expansion Envelope (50-Year Horizon)

#### Ultimate Capacity Targets
- **Electrical Generation:** Scale to approximately 5 GW nameplate
  - Phase 2 addition: ~3.5 GW (primarily solar expansion)
- **Liquid Fuels Production:** Scale to approximately 100,000 bpd
  - Product mix proportions may adjust based on market demand evolution

#### Expansion Contingency
- **Funding Model:** Phased, cash-flow-funded expansion
- **Rationale:** Each phase must be self-funding from prior-phase operations; no speculative debt financing on unproven capacity
- **Timing:** 50-year horizon allows for market evolution, technology maturation, and revenue accumulation to justify each expansion phase

#### Scaling Implications
- **Solar PV:** ~3.3x expansion (1.5 → 5 GW) on available flat land in northwest quadrant and reserve corridors
- **SOEC/H₂:** Proportional scaling to maintain H₂ production for synfuel synthesis (457 t/day → ~1,500 t/day estimated)
- **Data Centers:** Expansion from interim footprint to full reserved district (multi-building campus)
- **Biomass Feedstock:** External sourcing must scale proportionally to support larger synfuel production rates

### Master Guideline Document HC-MGD-001 Rev A

#### Document Status & Authority
- **Adoption Date:** 2025-12-27
- **Form:** Revision A baseline (may be superseded by Revision B, C, etc. as design matures)
- **Governance Scope:** Governing design baseline for ALL Heber Campus subsystems and interfaces
- **Authority Level:** Canonical document; exceptions require explicit ARCHITECT approval

#### Scope of HC-MGD-001
- Power system architecture (1.5 GW Phase 1, 5 GW ultimate)
- Refinery/synfuel production (18,000 bpd Phase 1, 100,000 bpd ultimate)
- Data center cluster design and cooling/power integration
- VVLS facility integration and launch operational protocols
- Site plan and infrastructure corridor standards
- Environmental, regulatory, and social governance
- Expansion-first design principles (Phase 1/Phase 2 compatibility)

#### Reference Standard
- All subsequent AO (Agile-Observable) design outputs must be cross-checked against HC-MGD-001 prior to geometry hardening
- Variances documented and ARCHITECT-approved

### Agricultural Footprint Removal & External Biomass Sourcing

#### Phase 1 Decision
- **Footprint Elimination:** Remove all agricultural production from physical Heber Campus property
- **Rationale:** Land utility maximization (solar, buildings, infrastructure corridors take priority); agricultural < energy density of engineered infrastructure
- **Biomass Supply:** Transition to contract/partnership supply model

#### Biomass Supply Strategy

**Primary Model: External Partnerships**
- Contract for feedstock delivery from existing agricultural/forestry operations in northern Arizona
- Supply chain flexibility: can source from multiple regional vendors without on-site cultivation constraints
- Lower capital: no on-site biomass production facilities (HRSG, handling equipment for harvested material only)

**Strategic Partnership: Navajo Nation**
- **Integration Scope:** Integrated but non-co-located supply relationship
- **Partnership Structure:** Long-term agricultural/foreststock contracts with Navajo Nation entities
- **Supply Target:** Herbaceous biomass (switchgrass, miscanthus) or wood residues (forest thinning byproducts)
- **Economic Benefit:** Revenue-sharing partnership supports Navajo Nation economy; Heber Campus obtains sustainable, regional feedstock
- **Scale:** Potential to source 100+ thousand tons/year to support 100,000 bpd refinery expansion at full buildout

### Employment Baseline & Scaling

#### Phase 1 (Initial Build-Out)
- **Direct Employment:** Approximately 750-800 jobs
- **Labor Categories:** 
  - Operations & maintenance (power, refinery, data center)
  - Manufacturing/assembly (VVLS hardware, synfuel testing)
  - Engineering & planning (AO design, subsystem integration)
  - Administration, security, environmental compliance
- **Wage Profile:** High-skill technical jobs (engineers, operators); regional wage baseline competitive with mining/energy sector

#### Phase 2 (Ultimate 5 GW / 100,000 bpd)
- **Direct Employment:** Approximately 1,800-2,300 jobs
- **Scaling Factor:** ~2.3x employment from Phase 1 → Phase 2
- **Role Evolution:** More maintenance/operations staff proportional to larger facility footprint; continuous data center operations growth
- **Economic Impact:** Highest per-capita employment opportunity in northern Arizona region

### Regional Labor Shed Model

#### Primary Feeder Communities
Identified commuting-distance communities with available workforce and housing:
1. **Winslow** (~50 miles south) — Historic rail hub; diverse labor pool
2. **Joseph City** (~25 miles southeast) — Rural agricultural community; light industrial experience
3. **Holbrook** (~70 miles east) — County seat; established services/housing
4. **Snowflake-Taylor** (~15 miles north) — Closest town cluster; primary feeder
5. **Show Low** (~40 miles north) — Regional employment hub; ski industry seasonal labor
6. **Payson** (~60 miles west/northwest) — Mountain community; outdoor recreation base

#### Commuting Distance Rationale
- 50-70 mile commute acceptable for high-wage technical jobs (3-4 hour round trip, carpool standard)
- Housing availability in feeder communities at rural price points (~$150-250K range estimated)
- No major city within short drive; workforce development strategy prioritizes skill training in existing communities

### Transportation Strategy & Regional Connectivity

#### Strategy Priority
- **Primary Focus:** Regional roadway and rail connectivity to/from campus
- **Explicit Constraint:** Minimize residential expansion within Heber-Overgaard town limits
- **Rationale:** Preserve town character; Heber Campus is major employment draw but not intended to transform local community into bedroom suburb

#### Infrastructure Strategy Components

1. **Rail Loop Connectivity**
   - Northbound spine toward I-40 leverages existing corridors
   - Goal: Heavy rail access for bulk fuel/chemical shipment and power plant equipment delivery
   - I-40 as terminal hub (national rail network access)

2. **Pipeline Access**
   - Northbound corridor also accommodates pipeline for synfuel export
   - Possibility of grid-interconnected H₂ pipeline to regional end-users (future)

3. **Highway Integration**
   - AZ-99 identified as preferred backbone for campus connectivity to I-40
   - Minimizes new road construction; builds on existing right-of-way where feasible

#### Specific Roadway Projects

**AZ-99 Backbone Upgrade**
- Current status: Exists but 2-lane configuration
- Role: Primary daily commute route for workforce; also main delivery/export route for bulk cargo
- Upgrade: Estimated 4-lane with truck lanes; cost split with state/county partners

**SR-260 Four-Lane Expansion**
- **Existing Study:** ADOT already planning SR-260 expansion as part of statewide corridor optimization
- **Heber Campus Role:** Material demand anchor (350-400 daily truck trips estimated at full buildout)
- **Leverage Opportunity:** Heber Campus can accelerate ADOT funding prioritization by demonstrated anchor demand
- **Timeline:** Coordination with state capital plan cycles (5-10 year horizon)

### Governance Engagement Sequencing

#### Phase Sequence (Early Engagement)
1. **Navajo County Leadership** (first)
   - County Commission, Economic Development Authority
   - Goal: Early county support, zoning alignment, permitting pathway clarity
   - Risk Mitigation: Establish local political baseline before state/federal engagement

2. **State Agencies** (second)
   - Arizona Department of Energy Minerals & Natural Resources
   - Arizona Corporation Commission (grid interconnection oversight)
   - ADOT (roadway planning coordination)
   - Arizona Department of Environmental Quality (air quality, water, waste permits)

3. **Federal Agencies** (third, contingent on state alignment)
   - U.S. Forest Service (if any national forest access required)
   - BLM (if public lands involved; unlikely at Heber-Overgaard)
   - Department of Energy (potential loan guarantees, hydrogen hub grants)

#### Rationale for Sequencing
- **Local First:** County's support is prerequisite for any larger engagement; early alignment reduces downstream opposition
- **State Next:** ADOT/environmental agencies set permitting pathway; state approval faster/more predictable than federal
- **Federal Last:** Engage after state/local alignment; federal grants/loans support pre-approved projects

### Integrated Power + Refinery + Data Center Campus Model

#### Economic Model Validation
- **Multi-Revenue-Stream Architecture:**
  1. Electricity export to grid (merchant power sales)
  2. Liquid fuels export (diesel, Jet-A, LPG merchant sales)
  3. Data center services (compute rental, cloud infrastructure)
  4. VVLS launch services (payload-to-orbit revenue)
  5. Hydrogen sales (if external market develops; currently internal)

#### Resilience & Budget Stability
- **Single-Revenue Dependency Risk Eliminated:** No single market collapse destroys economics
  - Power market downturn → refinery/data center/VVLS still operational
  - Fuel market volatility → power/data center/VVLS cushion margins
  - Data center demand plateau → power/fuel/VVLS still generate revenue
- **Revenue Timing Diversity:** Power (daily spot market), fuels (monthly contracts), data center (recurring SaaS), VVLS (per-launch)
- **Cost Absorption:** Fixed campus costs (payroll, utilities, maintenance) spread across 4-5 revenue streams = lower breakeven threshold

#### Financial Implications
- **IPO/Financing Attractiveness:** Multi-revenue campus model is materially stronger than pure-play power or pure-play refinery
- **Insurance/Risk Profile:** Portfolio approach makes project bankable even if one sector faces temporary downturn
- **Expansion Path:** Each revenue stream can fund next phase without dependent timing

#### Competitive Moat
- **Integrated Thermal Management:** Reject heat from power generation → synfuel synthesis thermal input → data center cooling source
- **Location Advantage:** Northern Arizona solar + seasonal cooling + workforce access + existing corridors = compound site advantage
- **Technology Integration:** VVLS facility uses campus power + hydrogen; launch services market exclusive to Heber location
